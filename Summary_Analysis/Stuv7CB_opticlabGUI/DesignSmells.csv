Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
Stuv7CB_opticlabGUI,(default package),Main,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Stuv7CB_opticlabGUI,stuv7cb.gui,ButtonRun,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SelectionLabel; MainFrame; ButtonRun; SetFrame; SetLense; SetSource; SetDisplay; SetMirror; SetPlate; SetLaser; SetPrism; SetSphereMirror; SetRealLense; SetEllepticMirror
Stuv7CB_opticlabGUI,stuv7cb.gui,LabelDisplay,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): LabelObject
Stuv7CB_opticlabGUI,stuv7cb.gui,LabelEllepticMirror,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): LabelObject
Stuv7CB_opticlabGUI,stuv7cb.gui,LabelLaser,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): LabelObject
Stuv7CB_opticlabGUI,stuv7cb.gui,LabelLense,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): LabelObject
Stuv7CB_opticlabGUI,stuv7cb.gui,LabelObject,Missing Hierarchy,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: MainPanel; MainFrame in method addPopup
Stuv7CB_opticlabGUI,stuv7cb.gui,LabelObject,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 39 methods
Stuv7CB_opticlabGUI,stuv7cb.gui,LabelPlate,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): LabelObject
Stuv7CB_opticlabGUI,stuv7cb.gui,LabelPrism,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): LabelObject
Stuv7CB_opticlabGUI,stuv7cb.gui,LabelRealLense,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): LabelObject
Stuv7CB_opticlabGUI,stuv7cb.gui,LabelSource,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): LabelObject
Stuv7CB_opticlabGUI,stuv7cb.gui,LabelSphereMirror,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): LabelObject
Stuv7CB_opticlabGUI,stuv7cb.gui,SelectionLabel.MyMouseListener,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
Stuv7CB_opticlabGUI,stuv7cb.gui,SelectionLabel.MyMouseListener,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
