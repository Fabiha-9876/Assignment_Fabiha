TechplexEngineer_OmniNode,omninode28,Connect,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: IO; Node; Connect
TechplexEngineer_OmniNode,omninode28,Driver,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
TechplexEngineer_OmniNode,omninode28,EditPanel,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): OmniPanel
TechplexEngineer_OmniNode,omninode28,EditPanel.DynamicListener,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
TechplexEngineer_OmniNode,omninode28,EditPanel.DynamicListener,Broken Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields are declared in this class: omniFrame; nodes; connections; fc; NP; EP; WorkingNode; lastPoint; onANode; end1; end2; count; moving; selectedCounter; n1; n2
TechplexEngineer_OmniNode,omninode28,EndUserPanel,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
TechplexEngineer_OmniNode,omninode28,EndUserPanel.DynamicListener,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
TechplexEngineer_OmniNode,omninode28,EndUserPanel.DynamicListener,Broken Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields are declared in this class: omniFrame; nodes; connections; fc; NP; EP; WorkingNode; onANode; end1; end2; count; moving; selectedCounter
TechplexEngineer_OmniNode,omninode28,Node,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 33 public methods
TechplexEngineer_OmniNode,omninode28,NodeEditFrame,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
TechplexEngineer_OmniNode,omninode28,PopupPanel,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
TechplexEngineer_OmniNode,omninode28,PopupPanel,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
TechplexEngineer_OmniNode,omninode28,SettingsFrame,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
