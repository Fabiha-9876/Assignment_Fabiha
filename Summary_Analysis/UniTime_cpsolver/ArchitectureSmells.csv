Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
UniTime_cpsolver,org.cpsolver.coursett,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): org.cpsolver.coursett.constraint; org.cpsolver.coursett.criteria; org.cpsolver.coursett.heuristics
UniTime_cpsolver,org.cpsolver.coursett,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Constants; Test; TimetableLoader; TimetableXMLLoader; TimetableXMLSaver; DomainChart; JenrlChart; GetInfo; IdConvertor; SolutionEvaluator; TimetableSaver]; [GetInfo.Info]; [GetMppInfo]; [Test.ShutdownHook]; [TimetableSolver]; [TimetableXMLLoader.DatePattern]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.38
UniTime_cpsolver,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 11.93.
