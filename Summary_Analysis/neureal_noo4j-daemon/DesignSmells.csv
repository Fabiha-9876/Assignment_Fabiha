Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
neureal_noo4j-daemon,org.noo4j.daemon,BtcAlertListener,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BtcNotificationSource
neureal_noo4j-daemon,org.noo4j.daemon,BtcBlockListener,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BtcNotificationSource
neureal_noo4j-daemon,org.noo4j.daemon,BtcBlockListener,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: BtcWalletListener; BtcDaemon; BtcBlockListener
neureal_noo4j-daemon,org.noo4j.daemon,BtcDaemon,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BtcJsonRpcHttpClient
neureal_noo4j-daemon,org.noo4j.daemon,BtcDaemon,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 129 public methods
neureal_noo4j-daemon,org.noo4j.daemon,BtcJsonRpcHttpClient,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 43 public methods
neureal_noo4j-daemon,org.noo4j.daemon,BtcWalletListener,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BtcNotificationSource
neureal_noo4j-daemon,org.noo4j.daemon,BtcDaemonMain,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
neureal_noo4j-daemon,org.noo4j.daemon,BtcDaemonTest,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because setGenerate is more interested in members of the type: BtcDaemon
neureal_noo4j-daemon,org.noo4j.daemon,BtcDaemonTest,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 64 public methods
