Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
ngladitz_emma,com.vladium.emma.ant,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): com.vladium.emma.instr
ngladitz_emma,com.vladium.emma.ant,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [FileTask; NestedTask; SuppressableTask; VerbosityCfg; XFileSet; FilterTask; GenericCfg; PropertyElement; IANTVersion]; [StringValue]; [VerbosityCfg.VerbosityAttribute]; [IANTVersion._ANTVersion]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.33
ngladitz_emma,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 7.48.
